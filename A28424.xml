            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Bloody Papiſt: Or, a True RELATION Of the Horrid and Barbarous MURDER Committed by one <hi>Ro Sherburn</hi> of <hi>Kyme</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> (a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious PAPIST,) upon his Wife, whom in an Inhumane Manner he Murder'd in her <hi>Bed,</hi> for which he is now a Priſoner in <hi>Lincoln-Goal.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AMongſt all the grievous and Raigning Sins too frequently Committed amongſt us, That of <hi>Murther,</hi> as it is one of the <hi>deepeſt dye,</hi> and moſt unnatural, ſo it deſerves the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſquiſition, and not only <hi>Cries</hi> loud to Heaven for <hi>Vengeance,</hi> but alſo to <hi>Gods Vicegerents</hi> on Earth, for exact and ſpeedy <hi>Juſtice</hi> to be inflicted on thoſe that are Guilty of it. To kill any Unlawfully, is no leſs than an Aſſault upon God in Effigie, a Defacing of the Divine Image: but when ſuch a Barbarous Crime ſhall be aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with Deſign and Premeditation, and ſuch a Circumſtance as this, that 'tis Acted againſt ſo near a Relation as is the ſame <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and whom, both the Laws of God and man, the Dictates of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and a mans own Solemn <hi>Vows,</hi> had in a ſpecial manner oblig'd him to Defend, Love, and Cheriſh, it ſwell beyond all Proportion of Ordinary Impiety, and grows monſtrouſly Deteſtable.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Ro. Sherburn</hi> liv'd at a Village call'd <hi>Kyme</hi> in <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> his Trade or Occupation, a <hi>Farmer</hi> or Dealer in Cattel; and by Profeſſion of Religion, a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> whether he were bred up ſo from his Infancy, or ſince Revolted and Apoſtatiz'd thereunto, we have not been able to Learn; 'Tis certain that for diverſe years paſt he has own'd himſelf of that Perſwaſion, and very Zealous and Obſtinate therein; and as to his Life and Converſation, it was ſuitable enough to the Principles of their Mock-Religion; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing ſtrange that thoſe whom God hath ſo far forſaken as to give them up to believe <hi>a Lie</hi> (for <hi>Popery</hi> in the whole Body of it is not other) ſhould likewiſe be left without <hi>Natural Affections,</hi> and abandon themſelves to <hi>Work all kind of Wickedneſs with Greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had long been married (by Report in the country near 20 years,) to an honeſt Loving and Induſtrious Woman, and to the outward view of the World they ſeem'd to live very agreeably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb facs="tcp:41274:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>till the Powerful Temptations of Satan (or his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) prompted him to this cruel and Savage Act; which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Account of the Neighbour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hood, was thus:</p>
            <p>That one night at the end of <hi>December</hi> laſt, ſhe being innocently ſleeping in her Bed, he moſt inhumanely Aſſaulted her, without any previous Provocation that we can hear of, on her part, and in a Barbarous manner <hi>Throtled</hi> or Suffocated her, and by Tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling upon her, and many furious <hi>Blows</hi> on her Stomach &amp; Bowels, beat the Breath out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er Body and killed her, and ſo left her dead, and betook himſelf to another Bed.</p>
            <p>Where though his Conſcience loaded with ſo much Guilt could not ſure ſuffer him to ſleep, yet there he continued the greateſt part of the next Forenoon, when ſome Neighbours wondring that they did not ſee the doors open'd, nor him abroad about his Buſineſs as he was wont to be; after ſeveral times knocking and calling, but no Anſwer, fearing ſome Misfortune had happen'd to them, broke open the Doors, and (to their Amazement) found her thus Murder'd in her Bed, and he Lying upon another.</p>
            <p>And receiving no Satisfaction from him to their Inquiries, but rather juſt reaſon to ſuſpect him to be the <hi>Aſſaſsinate,</hi> they carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him before a Magiſtrate, where having little to ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but ſome Triffling Evaſions; after due Examination, he having (in Effect) <hi>Confeſt</hi> that he kill'd her, was on New-years day laſt committed to <hi>Lincoln</hi> Goal, where he now remains, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his deſerved <hi>Doom</hi> at this next approaching Aſſizes.</p>
            <p>What Inducements the Devil made uſe of to tempt him to this horrid Villany is not yet certainly known; Whether any Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction he might perceive in her as to <hi>religion,</hi> or any Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to leave their <hi>Superſtitions</hi> and Embrace the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Faith, (as ſome Report)or whether it were only ſome private Grudge, or deſire to be rid of her (as others conceive) or whether it were upon ſome falling out between them, (as ſome relate) about 10 <hi>l.</hi> or ſome other ſum of Money, which ſhe had laid up and would not produce for him to diſpoſe of, I ſay which of all theſe things, or what elſe, it was, that egg'd him on to commit this ſaid Fact, is left to the proofs that ſhall appear at the Trial.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it is given out by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> that he <hi>was Diſtracted</hi> when he did it, and to add to the Probability, they alleadge that he was Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd in mind in his Youth about 20 years ago, and that having lately a fit of Sickneſs, they believe his Phrenſy might again revert and ſeize him; and though he now ſeem'd recovered of this late Sickneſs, and to be very well again, and went about his Buſineſs; yet they affirm he was ſtill Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in one of thoſe Frantick Fitts, not knowing what he did, Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Lamentable Miſchief.</p>
            <p>But how far they will be able to make theſe things appear, or whether they are only related in favour of him, and for the Credit of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall not undertake to determine.</p>
